      "Sanyasikatte Sri Parashurama Temple (Regd.), located at Mundaje in Belthangady taluk of Dakshina Kannada, stands as a serene tapobhumi in the Western Ghats. The shrine was established in 1915 by members of the Phadke family - Mani Ananta Bhat, Dumbettu Subraya Hebbar and Patla Ananta Bhat - who installed Sri Parashurama as the presiding deity at Sanyasikatte.",
      "In the following decades, the temple was lovingly nurtured by muktesars Mani Ganapathi Bhat and Mani Ramakrishna Phadke. In 1977 the founding family formally offered the temple to the public, and since then it has been a community-managed kshetra open to all devotees. The temple observes several regular celebrations: Deepotsava on Kartika Bahula Panchami, the Pratishta anniversary on Vaishakha Bahula Chaturthi, Udayasthamana Bhajane on Ashadha Shudda Ekadashi, Ugadi in the month of Chaitra, Satyanarayana Puja on every Sankramana, and the monthly Sankashta Hara Ganapati Puja.",
      "In 2018 the temple underwent a significant renovation and, with the cooperation of devotees, was rebuilt in traditional stone architecture. Today the complex includes shrines of Sri Parashurama (main deity), Sanyasi Purusha / Kshetrapala, Sri Siddhivinayaka, Sri Annapoorneshwari, the Navagrahas, Naga Devata and the Daivas, with daily puja performed as per tradition. The temple is revered as an abode where devotees seek removal of obstacles, family well-being, peace of mind, prosperity and the fulfillment of righteous wishes for all sections of the Hindu community."
